# Airline_Ratings
Basically a bunch of commands to find airline ratings

#Eg.
To find the rating of the airline Virgin Atlantic:
py main.py -c[--command] ratings -a[--airline] virgin_atlantic

#NOTE
Multiple airlines can be used at once, so to prevent spaces getting in the way, you would need to use a underscore. Virgin Atlantic would be virgin_atlantic.
